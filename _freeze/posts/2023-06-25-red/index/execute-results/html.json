A. (2017). Color saturation increases perceived product size. *Journal of Consumer Research, 44*(2), 396-413.\n\n# Team MA Spring 2021\n\n- Anaïs Merz\n- Nemanja Sobajic\n\n[OSF](https://osf.io/4cjqv/)\n[Pre-Reg (German)](https://osf.io/r2x4w)\n\n## Abstract\nThis research demonstrates a visual phenomenon with broad implications for consumers: the perceived size of products depends on the saturation of their color. Results from six experiments, employing objects and products with various shapes and hues, show that increasing color saturation increases size perceptions. This influence is explained by the tendency for saturated color to capture attention, which, in turn, is explained by the arousal that saturated color stimulates. This research also demonstrates several downstream outcomes of the effect of saturation on size perceptions: evaluations are more favorable—and willingness to pay is higher—for products with high (low) saturation when usage goals call for large (small) size. Additionally, participants choose more of a product to fill a container with higher saturation. Further, the saturation of an object’s color affects the perceived size of its surroundings, such that when a product with high (vs. low) saturation is used as a benchmark, the environment is perceived to be comparatively smaller (vs. larger). Implications for aesthetics, design, sensory marketing, and related topics are discussed. Lastly, to aid future color research, appendix A outlines general challenges and recommendations in connection with the conceptualization, manipulation, and measurement of color.\n\n# Replication\n\nWe ran a direct replication of experiment 1 to experiment 4 of HadHagtvedt & Brasel (2017). While the authors ran different samples for each of their experiments, we decided to use one larger subject pool and run all experiments (ie tasks) **within-subject** (in randomized order). Clearly there are benefits for each of these approaches, one could argue that repeating similar tasks would have transfer influences, on the other hand having a much larger sample (the smallest sample size in the original work was 56, in our study we collected 261 participants) gives us a better power to detect even small effects. \n\nA second, more relevant deviation from the original work is the **lab-online difference**. The authors collected their data in the lab with standardized calibration on the same monitors. We ran our sample online, meaning that we do not have control on setup and color calibration. We will get back to this point in the caveats below.\n\n# Demographics\n\nThe original paper had the following number of participants in each experiment: \n\n- **Exp1** 56 \n- **Exp2** 58\n- **Exp3** 80\n- **Exp4** 160 \n\nOverall we collected data from **328 participants**. Two pre-registered attention checks were built into the questionnaire which had to be **passed both** for inclusion. This step reduced the sample to: **270 participants**. Finally we asked participants whether they are color-blind - this step removed two participants. \n\nAfter aplying these exclusion criteriawe ended up with 261 participants (56.4% female). Female participants were on average *M =* 44.8 years, *SD =* 11.3 years, male participants were  *M =* 41 years, *SD =* 8.5 years.\n\n\n## Experiment 1 - The Cube (Original Study 1)\n\nExperiment 1 tests a simple idea - **color saturation changes size perception of objects**. In the original it says: `Participants are exposed to cubes with high- versus low-saturation color and identify which one they perceive to be larger.' \n\n![Cubes 100%-25% saturation](images/cubes_overview.png){#fig-exp1}\n\nWhile setting up the experiment we added two additions in the experimental setup: 1) instead of having just two levels (high-low `saturation`) we decided to use **4-levels** of `saturation`: 25%, 50% 75%, 100% (as can be seen in @fig-exp1). We also added an additional answering option 'the same' (in the original work the options were 'left' or 'right' to identify the larger cube). Hence we ensured that participants had the option to state that they perceive the cubes as having the same size. \n\nWe used binary choices on the one side (counterbalanced) cubes with either [25%, 50%, or 75%] `saturation` on the other left side 100% `saturation`.  \n\n## Either left or right (direct replication)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Replication Experiment 1](staticfig-results-A2-1.png){#fig-results-A2 fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-results-A2 plots the results for each of the three conditions - 25 v 100, 50 v 100 (the original condition) and 75 v 100. It becomes clear that we nicely replicate the finding of the authors with consistent *larger judgments* for the *higher saturation* condition (ie 100). Following the analysis in the original work, we ran chi2 tests for each of the three conditions, revealing significant differences for the \n\n**25 condition** \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tChi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  table(cube_A2_25$response, cube_A2_25$Sat)\nX-squared = 6, df = 1, p-value = 0.02\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**50 condition** \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tChi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  table(cube_A2_50$response, cube_A2_50$Sat)\nX-squared = 11, df = 1, p-value = 0.001\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**75 condition**\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tChi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  table(cube_A2_75$response, cube_A2_75$Sat)\nX-squared = 10, df = 1, p-value = 0.001\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPretty cool!\n\n## Left or right or simply the same.\n\nAnais and Nemanja came up with a question - but what if people want to say - 'hey these two cubes look the same size?'. Extension to the above experiment 1 - let us add a third answering option where participants can either say 'left' or 'right' or 'same' (for both having the same perceived size.)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Replication Experiment 1 - Three answering options](staticfig-results-A3-1.png){#fig-results-A3 fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-results-A3 shows the results of this little adventure. Hmm - clearly there is a strong preference for participants choosing the 'same' size option (in grey). This effect seems to depend on the `saturation` (the distance between the left and right cube) - the smaller the difference, the harder it is to keep the cubes apart. Inspecting the cell sizes in the different conditions we see that for 25 and 50 the percentage of left-right answers is quite small. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Number of answers per condition Experiment 1 - Three answering options'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n# Groups:   Sat [3]\n  Sat   response     n   sum   perc\n  <fct> <fct>    <int> <int>  <dbl>\n1 25    0            1    36 0.0278\n2 25    1            3    36 0.0833\n3 25    2           32    36 0.889 \n4 50    0            5    37 0.135 \n5 50    1            8    37 0.216 \n6 50    2           24    37 0.649 \n7 75    0           15    54 0.278 \n8 75    1           14    54 0.259 \n9 75    2           25    54 0.463 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, running tests on this does not really make sense, but we can at least check the 75 condition: \n\n**75 condition** \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tChi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  table(cube_A3_75$response, cube_A3_75$Sat)\nX-squared = 4, df = 2, p-value = 0.1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs one would expect from the table above - we find no significant preference for left or right - just by adding a 'same' option in our experiment. \n\n## Experiment 2 - Laptops (Original Study 3)\n\nIn the original paper study 2 was run with an eye-tracker recording, in addition to eye-movements also pupil dilation. We did not have an eye-tracker at hand for this study - so we moved on to the original study 3 asking whether color `saturation` has an attention grabing effect, an effect on arousal and an effect on size perception. Hagtvedt and Brasel (2017) only ran one color (red). As different colors have different attention grabing effects, we extended the material to three colors (see @fig-exp2). \n\n![Laptops 100% & 50% saturation](images/laptops_overview.png){#fig-exp2}\n\nIn the original study laptops were shown in a projection on the wall, we, again, use our online sample. Here is what we are looking for - results from study 3 (p. 400) in @fig-study3-results.\n\n![ANOVA results study 3](images/study3_results.png){#fig-study3-results}\n\nLet's first plot what we find for the three colors: \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Replication Study 3 - Size](staticfig-results-L-1.png){#fig-results-L fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nLet us first look only at the red stimuli - they were also used in the original.

We plot the averages for these dependent measures in @fig-results-A and @fig-results-M.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Replication Study 3 - Arrousal](staticfig-results-A-1.png){#fig-results-A fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nChecking with a simple ANOVA for an effect on arousal - no significant effect is found.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nColor         2      2    1.05    0.31   0.73\nSat           1      1    0.83    0.25   0.62\nColor:Sat     2      4    1.99    0.60   0.55\nResiduals   262    878    3.35               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Replication Study 3 - Mood](staticfig-results-M-1.png){#fig-results-M fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAgain checking with a simple ANOVA we see no significant effect is found.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nColor         2      6    2.94    0.78   0.46\nSat           1      1    0.60    0.16   0.69\nColor:Sat     2      1    0.35    0.09   0.91\nResiduals   262    986    3.76               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo overall we do not find any effects of `saturation` on estimated `size`, `arrousal` or `mood`.\n\n## Experiment 3 - Suitcases (Original Study 4)\n\nIntention could have an influence on the `size` effect the authors found - so in their next experiment an 'image of an orange carry-on suitcase projected on a large screen, which served as the basis for completing paper questionnaires. The carry-on was either high or low in color saturation'. In addition the goal of a potential purchase process was manipulated: **Goal manipulation**: 'Imagine that you want to purchase a carry-on suitcase that is large enough to fit plenty of your belongings' vs. 'small enough to fit easily into an overhead storage compartment'.\n\nWhat Hagtvedt and Brasel were looking for is the following interaction: 'We expected participants with the goal of a large (vs. small) carry-on to prefer the one with high (vs. low) color saturation, given the hypothesized influence of color saturation on perceived size.'\n\nSo - lets see if we can replicate this effect. \n\nWe use the 4 levels of `saturation` (instead of two in the original work) as can be seen in @fig-exp3. \n\n![Suitcases 100%-25% saturation](images/suitcases_overview.png){#fig-exp3}\n\nPlotting @fig-results-suitcase we see that there are hardly any differences between the two targets `large` or `small` and, judging visually, no main effect of `saturation`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Suitcase](staticfig-results-suitcase-1.png){#fig-results-suitcase fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe qualify this with a simple ANOVA - no significant effect of `saturation ` or `target` (ie goal) found, in addition the interaction is not significant either.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nSat           3      5    1.79    0.73   0.54\ntarget        1      1    1.26    0.51   0.47\nSat:target    3      6    1.95    0.79   0.50\nResiduals   256    628    2.46               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe same is true if we use willingness to pay (`prize`) as a dependent variable. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nSat           3   1784     595    1.02   0.38\ntarget        1   1036    1036    1.78   0.18\nSat:target    3    219      73    0.13   0.95\nResiduals   256 149122     583               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, again we do not find any effects of `saturation` on the quality `evaluation` or estimated `prize`.\n\n## Experiment 4 - Couches (Original Study 6)\n\nFor our final replication we look at an effect of `saturation` on judgements of the environment of an object. The authors write: 'We expected that a room’s ceiling height would appear comparatively lower when the color of a benchmark in the room —an ottoman— is high (vs. low) in saturation.'\n\nWe replaced the ottoman with a couch, used the same `saturation` levels but added two additional colors (see @fig-exp4). \n\n![Couches 100% & 50% saturation](images/couches_overview.png){#fig-exp4}\n\n\nPlotting @fig-results-couch we see that there are hardly any differences between the two `saturation` levels and also (as expected) no effect of `color`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Results Couch](staticfig-results-couch-1.png){#fig-results-couch fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRunnning the ANOVA on the data we find no significant effect of `saturation` or `color` and no interaction.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nSat           1    265     265    0.24   0.62\nColor         2    142      71    0.07   0.94\nSat:Color     2    337     168    0.15   0.86\nResiduals   256 278201    1087               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Caveats\n\nAs mentioned above we did not replicate the original studies exactly. We used slighty different objects and additional saturation levels. More importantly we used the same participants again in a **within-subjects** design in an **online** experiment instead of a lab study. Nevertheless in our study 1 we see the same effect of `saturation` on `size` as the authors did in their study 1 - so in principle the effect can be replicated but only for the cubes (without adding an option to judge the cubes as having the same size - then this effect also goes away). \n\n**BUT**: in study 2 we do not find any effects of `saturation` on `size`, `arousal` or `mood`; in study 3 we do not find any effects of `saturation` on `evaluation` or `prize`; in study 4 we do not find any effects of `saturation` on `guessed height`.\n\nI was quite suspicious about the described effects in the original work and my confindence in the effect of `saturation` on `size` did not really increase after this exercise.\n\n# References\n\nHagtvedt, H., & Brasel, S.
