Unfortunatly (my uni)[www.unibe.ch] is locked in with Ilias - this post is not about this sad truth but a solution for all my interactions with students in my courses. What I was looking for is an easy, reproducible solution that allows me to generate slides, pdfs of said slides (students want pdfs for taking notes) and a webpage with all the necessary info about the course in one go. Ideally I want to work together with a TA on all of this. \n\nSo, here we go: I am teaching a lot of methods courses - hence [Quarto](quarto.org) is a natural choice. For the combination of slides and a webpage a Quarto Project.  \n\nSimply get started with:\n\n![Quarto project setup](images/project_setup.png)\nWhat you get from this is a new R-Project (I chose a new folder on my Desktop), called it `Course_Project` and also setup a git repo right away (more about that later). Within the project folder you will find a .qmd file that will hold the landing page, an .Rproj file to keep things together and a `_quarto.yml` file to configure everything. You can already open an render the .qmd file and will see a simple html page. \n\n```{markdown, eval=FALSE}\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: public\n  render:\n    - \"*.qmd\"\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto\n  echo: true\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Project Title\"\n  description: \"More details\"\n  site-url: \"https://...\"\n  favicon: \"_images/hex_decide.webp\"\n  google-analytics:\n    tracking-id: \"XXX\"\n  page-navigation: true\n  page-footer:\n    left: \"&copy; 2025 Name\"\n    center: \"Some more super sensible stuff\"\n    \n  sidebar:\n    background: \"#0035bd\"\n    logo: \"_images/hex_decide.webp\"\n    pinned: true\n    align: center\n    style: docked\n    type: dark\n    contents:\n     - href: index.qmd\n       text: Home\n     - text: \"---\"\n     - section: Slides\n       contents:\n       - href: 1_Session1/index.qmd\n         text: Welcome\n       - href: 2_Session2/index.qmd\n         text: Topic Session 2\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    author: \"Your Name\"\n    theme: [flatly, theme.scss]\n    toc: true\n    smooth-scroll: true\n    link-external-newwindow: true\n    code-link: true\n    code-copy: true\n    code-overflow: scroll\n    mainfont: Atkinson Hyperlegible\n    highlight-style: a11y\n    code-fold: true\n    execute:\n      echo: false\n  revealjs:\n    author: \"\"\n    logo: \"_images/hex_decide.webp\"\n    width: 1600\n    height: 900\n    menu: false\n    theme: slides.scss\n    #highlight-style: a11y\n    #highlight-style: github\n    transition: none\n    slide-number: true\n    header-includes: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://kit.fontawesome.com/dcfae09aca.css\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n    bibliography: biblio.bib\n    fig-width: 16\n    fig-height: 10\n\n\n```\n\n",
