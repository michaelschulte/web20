I'm an Associate Professor for Research Methods and Decision Science at the University of Bern and also hold an Associate Researcher position at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin. My research focuses on understanding how people make decisions—not just what they choose-but the processes that unfold as they decide.

## Research

I develop and apply process-tracing methods that open a window into the mind during decision-making. These methods—including eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, and information board paradigms like MouselabWeb—allow us to observe the dynamics of information acquisition, integration, and preference formation in real time. 


## Teaching 

At the University of Bern, I teach Marketing Research Methods, where I emphasize both methodological rigor and practical application. My courses blend traditional research methods with hands-on experience in R programming and data visualization. 

## Recent Publications

We published a comprehensive tutorial on movement tracking in [Behavior Research Methods](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02695-2). A guide through the entire process of using the [mousetrap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mousetrap/index.html) R package to study psychological processes through mouse cursor movements.
