## What I am interested in
I study how people make decisions. More specifically, I am interested in what (cognitive) processes happen, when we make decisions and how we can measure all of that. Within these lines of research I developed my own tools to study decision processes ([WebDiP](https://github.com/michaelschulte/webdip), [Flashlight](https://github.com/michaelschulte/flashlight), [The pyeTribe](https://github.com/michaelschulte/ThePyeTribe)) and want to understand decisions in the lab, under controlled circumstances as well as in the wild.

Furthermore I am interested in open [science|data|methods], replication studies and new (and old) teaching methods.

## Current position
University of Bern, Switzerland 

Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin.
