Two unpublished replications of this study by the original authors, designed to verify the appropriate testing procedures, observed a smaller difference between conditions (2-3%) as well as a gender difference: men showed the effect (9.3% and 7.6%) but women did not (0.3% and -0.3%). The procedure used in those replications served as the basis for this multi-lab Registered Replication Report (RRR). A total of 40 laboratories collected data for this project, with 23 laboratories meeting all inclusion criteria. Here we report the meta-analytic result of those 23 direct replications (total N = 4,493) of the updated version of the original study, examining the difference between priming with professor and hooligan on a 30-item general knowledge trivia task (a supplementary analysis reports results with all 40 labs, N = 6,454). We observed no overall difference in trivia performance between participants primed with professor and those primed with hooligan (0.14%) and no moderation by gender."

    "text": "One of the root causes of where we are (as a science) in psychology and many other disciplines in terms of reproducibility of key (and other) results could not be better summed up than by the man himself Daryl Bem (2002):\n“If a datum suggests a new hypothesis, try to find additional evidence for it elsewhere in the data. If you see dim traces of interesting patterns, try to reorganize the data to bring them into bolder relief. If there are participants you don’t like, or trials, observers, or interviewers who gave you anomalous results, drop them (temporarily). Go on a fishing expedition for something — anything — interesting.”\n‘Go on a fishing expidition’ – why should there come anything good from such advise? Bem goes on …\n“No, this is not immoral (SIC!). The rules of scientific and statistical inference that we overlearn in graduate school apply to the “Context of Justification.” They tell us what we can conclude in the articles we write for public consumption, and they give our readers criteria for deciding whether or not to believe us. But in the “Context of Discovery,” there are no formal rules, only heuristics or strategies.”\nI disagree with this statement, because the idea of finding something through torturing the data (until they confess) is a hug source of false positive results. We find an effect and falsely conclude that something is there when in fact there is nothing. I found the above quote when reading this paper by Zwaan, Etz, Lucas & Donnellan (2017) – a target article for BBS which presents six common arguments against replication and a set of really good responses for such discussions.\nHere are the six ‘concerns’ the authors discuss:\n\n\n&lt;div class=\"layoutArea\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"column\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Concern I: Context Is Too Variable&lt;br /&gt; Concern II: The Theoretical Value of Direct Replications is Limited&lt;br /&gt; Concern III: Direct Replications Are Not Feasible in Certain Domains&lt;br /&gt; Concern IV: Replications are a Distraction&lt;br /&gt; Concern V: Replications Affect Reputations&lt;br /&gt; Concern VI: There is no Standard Method to Evaluate Replication Results\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    \n    &lt;p&gt;\n      Both are really good reads &#8211; for very different reasons.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    \n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &nbsp;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    \n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &#8212;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nBern, D.

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis research demonstrates a visual phenomenon with broad implications for consumers: the perceived size of products depends on the saturation of their color. Results from six experiments, employing objects and products with various shapes and hues, show that increasing color saturation increases size perceptions. This influence is explained by the tendency for saturated color to capture attention, which, in turn, is explained by the arousal that saturated color stimulates. This research also demonstrates several downstream outcomes of the effect of saturation on size perceptions: evaluations are more favorable—and willingness to pay is higher—for products with high (low) saturation when usage goals call for large (small) size. Additionally, participants choose more of a product to fill a container with higher saturation. Further, the saturation of an object’s color affects the perceived size of its surroundings, such that when a product with high (vs. low) saturation is used as a benchmark, the environment is perceived to be comparatively smaller (vs. larger). Implications for aesthetics, design, sensory marketing, and related topics are discussed. Lastly, to aid future color research, appendix A outlines general challenges and recommendations in connection with the conceptualization, manipulation, and measurement of color."

We also added an additional answering option ‘the same’ (in the original work the options were ‘left’ or ‘right’ to identify the larger cube). Hence we ensured that participants had the option to state that they perceive the cubes as having the same size.\nWe used binary choices on the one side (counterbalanced) cubes with either [25%, 50%, or 75%] saturation on the other left side 100% saturation."

Hagtvedt and Brasel (2017) only ran one color (red). As different colors have different attention grabing effects, we extended the material to three colors (see Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Laptops 100% & 50% saturation\n\n\n\nIn the original study laptops were shown in a projection on the wall, we, again, use our online sample.

Redundancy, the saliency of missing information, and density, the description of options in one or multiple chunks, was manipulated in a matrix setup presented in MouselabWeb. On the choice level we found a framing effect only in setups with non-redundant information. On the process level outcomes attracted more acquisitions than probabilities, irrespective of redundancy. A dissociation between acquisition behavior and choice calls for a critical discussion of the limits of process-tracing measures for understanding and predicting choices in decision making tasks."

    "title": "How WEIRD subjects can be overcome … a comment on Henrich et al.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Joe Henrich published a target article in BBS talking about how economics and psychology base their research on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) subjects.\nHere is the whole abstract:\n—\nBehavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world’s top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers—often implicitly—assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species—frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior—hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.\n—\nI would like to make three suggestions that could help to overcome the era of WEIRD subjects and generate more reliable and representative data. These suggestions will mainly touch contrasts 2, 3 and 4 elaborated by Henrich, Heine and Norezayan. While my suggestions tackle these contrasts from a technical and experimental perspective they do not provide a general solution for the first contrast on industrialized versus small scale societies. Here are my suggestions: 1) replications in multiple labs, 2) internet based experimentation and 3) drawing representative samples from a population.\nThe first suggestion, replication in multiple labs, foremost touches aspects like replication, multiple populations and open data access. For a publication in a journal a replication of an experiment in a different lab would be obligatory. The replication would then be published with the original, e.g., in the form of a comment. This would ensure that other research labs in other states or countries are involved and very different parts of the population could be sampled. Also results of experiments would be freely available to the public and the data sharing problem in Psychology, as described in the target article, but also in other fields like Medicine (Savage & Vieckers, 2009) would be a problem of the past. Of course such a step would be closely linked with certain standards on the one hand in building experiments and on the other hand in storing data. While a standard way to build experiments seems unlikely there are many methods available in computer science to store data in a reusable, for example through the usage of XML (Extensible Markup Language).\nThe second suggestion is based on the drawing of representative samples from the population. As described in the target article, research often suffers from a restriction to extreme subgroups from the population, from which generalized results are drawn. However, there is published work that overcomes these restrictions. As an example I would like to use the Hertwig, Zangerl, Biedert and Margraf (2008) paper on probabilistic numeracy. The authors based their study on a random-quote sample from the Swiss population including indicators as language, area where participant is living, gender and age. To fulfill all the necessary criteria 1000 participants were recruited using telephone interviews. Such studies are certainly more expensive and somewhat restricted to simpler experimental setups (Hertwig et al., used telephone interviews based on questionnaires).\nThe third suggestion adds additional data collection in a second location: the Internet. The emphasis in the last sentence should be set on ‘add’. Data collection solely Internet based is of course possible, already often performed and published in high impact journals. Online experimentation is technically much less demanding than ten years ago due to the availability of ready made solutions for questionnaires or even experiments. The point I would like to make here should not be built on a separation of lab and online based experiments. My suggestion combines these two research locations and enables a researcher to profit from the many benefits arising. A possible scenario could include running an experiment in the laboratory first to guarantee, among other things, high control on the situation in order to show an effect with a small, restricted sample. In a second step the experiment is transferred to the Web and run online, admittedly giving away some of the control but providing the large benefit of having access to a diverse, large samples of participants from different populations easily. As an example I would like to point to a recent blog and related experiments started by Paolacci and Warglien (2009) at the University of Venice, Italy. These researchers started replicating well known experiments from the decision making literature like framing, anchoring or the conjunction fallacy with a service called the Mechanical Turk provided by Amazon. This service is based on the idea of crowdsourcing (outsourcing a task to a large group of people) and lets a researcher have easy access to a large group of motivated participants.\nSome final words on the combination and possible restrictions of the three suggestions. What would a combination of all three suggestions look like? It would be a replication of experiments, using representative samples of different populations in online experiments. This seems useful from a data quality, logistics and prize point of view. However, several issues were left untouched in my discussion, such as the question of independence of the second lab for replication studies, the restriction of representative samples to one country (as opposed to multiple comparisons as routinely found in, e.g., anthropological studies), the differences between online and lab based experimentation or the instances where equipment needed for an experiments (e.g., eye trackers or fMRI) does not allow for online experimentation. Keeping that in mind the above suggestions draw an idealized picture of how to run experiments and re-use the collected data, nevertheless I would argue that such steps could help to reduce the percentage of WEIRD subjects in research substantially.\nReferences\nHertwig, R., Zangerl, M.A., Biedert, E., & Margraf, J.

The authors examine a recently proposed choice strategy, the priority heuristic, which provides a novel account of how people make risky choices. The authors identify a number of properties that the priority heuristic should have as a process model and illustrate how they may be tested. The results, along with prior research, suggest that although the priority heuristic captures some variability in the attention paid to outcomes, it fails to account for major characteristics of the data, particularly the frequent transitions between outcomes and their probabilities. The article concludes with a discussion of the properties that should be captured by process models of risky choice and the role of process data in theory development."

This is pretty weird – which becomes obvious when looking at the data from the paper below. In this paper we simply instruct participants to follow a strategy when making choices between risky gamble problems. Taking the example of fixation duration we see that there is surprisingly litte difference between calculating an expected value, using a heuristic (priority heuristic) and just making decisions without instructions (no instruction) … maybe we should rethink our mapping of observation to cognitive processes a bit?\nHere is the paper:\nSchulte-Mecklenbeck, M., Kühberger, A., Gagl, S., & Hutzler, F. (in press). Inducing thought processes: Bringing process measures and cognitive processes closer together. Journal of Behavioral Decision Making.\nAbstract: The challenge in inferring cognitive processes from observational data is to correctly align overt behavior with its covert cognitive process. To improve our understanding of the overt–covert mapping in the domain of decision making, we collected eye-movement data during decisions between gamble-problems. Participants were either free to choose or instructed to use a specific choice strategy (maximizing expected value or a choice heuristic). We found large differences in looking patterns between free and instructed choices. Looking patterns provided no support for the common assumption that attention is equally distributed between outcomes and probabilities, even when participants were instructed to maximize expected value. Eye-movement data are to some extent ambiguous with respect to underlying cognitive processes."

A third of these fatal accidents are attributed to speeding, with properties of the individual driver and the environment regarded as key contributing factors. We examine real-world speeding behavior and its interaction with illuminance, an environmental property defined as the luminous flux incident on a surface. Drawing on an analysis of 1.2 million vehicle movements, we show that reduced illuminance levels are associated with increased speeding. This relationship persists when we control for factors known to influence speeding (e.g., fluctuations in traffic volume) and consider proxies of illuminance (e.g., sight distance). Our findings add to a long-standing debate about how the quality of visual conditions affects drivers’ speed perception and driving speed. Policy makers can intervene by educating drivers about the inverse illuminance‒speeding relationship and by testing how improved vehicle headlights and smart road lighting can attenuate speeding."

We started off with an anchoring task, the classic: multiply the following numbers 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9 for one group and the reverse for the second seemed a little to hard for 8-years old so I used addition instead 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9. This worked reasonably well (a brave helper typed in the numbers, while I worked through another example with them) and we could demonstrate quite a substantial anchoring effect (400 v 1400) which was explained back to me, by one of the kids in great detail - pretty cool."

    "text": "I spend a lot of time writing and answering email. Email is, according to timing, the third longest activity on my computer (although I am using three computers and can check this only on one of them – #timing please let us link computers for an overall analysis) … anyway – back to no email – as a holiday treat I decided to shut down all my email accounts 5 days before Dec. 24th and promised myself not to touch them until Jan. 11th. It turns out that I will come short one day of this plan. Nevertheless, I am quite happy with the result and the positive effects of this email absence. Needless to say that reading emails during vacation brings you back into a working mood (or never lets you out of it), not reading email had positive side effects before (I did this twice in the last 20 years of ‘doing’ emails). Many issues that come during such a break often solve themselves without intervention or can be solved quickly within a few hours after being back in the email world.\nWell, I will turn on my email accounts now and see how much work has piled up … BRB.\nSo, 380 emails later – a paper submitted by a co-author, a rejection for a previous submission, a talk accepted, a chapter revised by a co-author – the best part of all this is that dealing with a ton of mails is a very quick thing, with a relatively low threshold for simply deleting out of date emails or replying quickly to urgent matters. What’s left are some longer replies I will do now …\nHappy New Year!"

Using the formula for Cohen’s d we want to calculate:\n\\(d = {M_{2} - M_{1} \\over SD_{pooled}}\\)\nwhere\n\\(SD_{pooled} = {\\sqrt{SD_{1}^2 + SD_{2}^2} \\over 2}\\)\n\nsd_pooled &lt;- sqrt((4.7^2 + 6.3^2)/2)\nd &lt;- (4.6 - 2.7) / sd_pooled\n\nSo, we get a Cohen’s d = 0.34, which constitutes a small effect according to Cohen, 1992. Lets see how our own replication does for Experiment 1a.\nOur 150 participants each made 45 choices, so we are expecting a tibble with 150*45 = 6750 rows.

Note that we updated the items to something more relevant these days.\n \n\nCheck for transitivity\nLee et al. write on p. 176 “For simplicity in reporting the results, we focus on violations in the form of three-way preference cycles (e.g., \\(p_{x} ≥ p_{y}, p_{y} ≥ p_{z}\\) and \\(p_{z} ≥ p_{x}\\))”\nSo, we will do the same :) - first we setup a tibble with all possible triplets and then identify (in)transitivity for choices on each product pair and then pair-triplets.\ngtools provides functions to “Enumerate the Combinations or Permutations of the Elements of a Vector” - cool - exactly what we need … The function takes two arguments n = the size of the source vector, in our case 10 products, and r = size of the target vector, our triplets. This gives us a 720x3 matrix (only the first 5 rows displayed here).\n\n# generate combinations\ncomb &lt;- permutations(n = 10, r = 3)\nhead(comb, 5)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    2    3\n[2,]    1    2    4\n[3,]    1    2    5\n[4,]    1    2    6\n[5,]    1    2    7\n\n\nWe transfer the matrix into a tibble and paste together all combinations of products - so there are three pairs that identify the three combinations of products. The new variable defines all transitive choices for all possible permutations of choice pairs.\n\n# generate space with all possible choice combinations\nspace &lt;- \nas_tibble(comb) %&gt;%\n  mutate(pair1 = paste0(V1,V2),\n         pair2 = paste0(V2,V3),\n         pair3 = paste0(V1,V3),\n         transitive = paste0(V1,V2,V1)) %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with('V'))\nspace\n\n# A tibble: 720 × 4\n   pair1 pair2 pair3 transitive\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n 1 12    23    13    121       \n 2 12    24    14    121       \n 3 12    25    15    121       \n 4 12    26    16    121       \n 5 12    27    17    121       \n 6 12    28    18    121       \n 7 12    29    19    121       \n 8 12    210   110   121       \n 9 13    32    12    131       \n10 13    34    14    131       \n# ℹ 710 more rows\n\n\nNow for some joining. We want to join the actual choices of each participant back into the matrix we generated above, with all the permutations of my 10 items. This is a little step by step operation, cause we want to join based on three different variables (pairs 1, 2 and 3). The first join is straight forward, for every row in pair 1 match the choice (and all other information about participants, experiment etc) from Lee_Choice_Coded, then rename the coded_choice variable and go on and match on pair2 now - note that we add ID and condition (although ID should be enough?), rename again and then match based on pair3.\n\n\n# A tibble: 54,360 × 10\n   pair1 pair2 pair3 transitive Experiment condition ID       coded_choice1\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;\n 1 12    23    13    121        Lee2       pictures  8Y3uw8Wz             2\n 2 12    23    13    121        Lee4       B&W       D9JSme3C             2\n 3 12    23    13    121        Lee4       B&W       3iTJmoTV             2\n 4 12    23    13    121        Lee2       pictures  47Z1QWBC             2\n 5 12    23    13    121        Lee3       color     KLMDkXi9             2\n 6 12    23    13    121        L1a        names     ZVQFirwo             2\n 7 12    23    13    121        Lee4       B&W       u0L1YrCo             2\n 8 12    23    13    121        Lee2       pictures  nOffEONb             2\n 9 12    23    13    121        Lee3       color     Hstldczk             2\n10 12    23    13    121        L1a        names     zEAhW9Wh             2\n# ℹ 54,350 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: coded_choice2 &lt;int&gt;, coded_choice3 &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nSo, that looks about right - what is left to do is to paste together the actual choices and then test these choice triples coded_choice_triple against the transitive variable we generated above - which gives us a logical vector called test.\n\n\n# A tibble: 54,360 × 6\n   transitive Experiment condition ID       choice_triple test \n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 121        Lee2       pictures  8Y3uw8Wz 233           FALSE\n 2 121        Lee4       B&W       D9JSme3C 223           FALSE\n 3 121        Lee4       B&W       3iTJmoTV 223           FALSE\n 4 121        Lee2       pictures  47Z1QWBC 223           FALSE\n 5 121        Lee3       color     KLMDkXi9 233           FALSE\n 6 121        L1a        names     ZVQFirwo 223           FALSE\n 7 121        Lee4       B&W       u0L1YrCo 223           FALSE\n 8 121        Lee2       pictures  nOffEONb 221           FALSE\n 9 121        Lee3       color     Hstldczk 223           FALSE\n10 121        L1a        names     zEAhW9Wh 233           FALSE\n# ℹ 54,350 more rows\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Groups:   Experiment [5]\n  Experiment condition av_intrans sd_intrans\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 L1a        names           53.1       24.2\n2 Lee2       pictures        49.9       28.0\n3 Lee3       color           47.0       23.5\n4 Lee4       B&W             46.7       29.3\n5 &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;           100         NA"

And reproducability is great with R because the code is always written in a text-file and not bound by software versions (as in other three or four letter (feel free to combine from: [A, P, S]) packages)."

    "text": "Abstract\nProspect theory’s S-shaped weighting function is often said to reflect the psychophysics of chance. We propose an affective rather than psychophysical deconstruction of the weighting function resting on two assumptions. First, preferences depend on the affective reactions associated with potential outcomes of a risky choice. Second, even with monetary values controlled, some outcomes are relatively affect-rich and others relatively affect-poor. Although the psychophysical and affective approaches are complementary, the affective approach has one novel implication: Weighting functions will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich than affect-poor outcomes. That is, people will be more sensitive to departures from impossibility and certainty but less sensitive to intermediate probability variations for affect-rich outcomes. We corroborated this prediction by observing probability-outcome interactions: An affect-poor prize was preferred over an affect-rich prize under certainty, but the direction of preference reversed under low probability. We suggest that the assumption of probability-outcome independence, adopted by both expected-utility and prospect theory, may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, but not different affective values."

The (in)visibility of psychodiagnosticians’ expertise. Journal of Behavioral Decision Making.\nThis study investigates decision making in mental health care. Specifically, it compares the diagnostic decision outcomes (i.e., the quality of diagnoses) and the diagnostic decision process (i.e., pre-decisional information acquisition patterns) of novice and experienced clinical psychologists. Participants’ eye movements were recorded while they completed diagnostic tasks, classifying mental disorders. In line with previous research, our findings indicate that diagnosticians’ performance is not related to their clinical experience. Eye-tracking data pro- vide corroborative evidence for this result from the process perspective: experience does not predict changes in cue inspection patterns. For future research into expertise in this domain, it is advisable to track individual differences between clinicians rather than study differences on the group level."

Levav et al analysed rulings in court cases and link them to the time when these rulings were made during the day.

    "title": "Psychology as a reproducible Science",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Is Psychology ready for reproducible research?\nToday the typical research process in psychology looks generally like this: we collect data; analyze them in many ways; write a draft article based on some of the results; submit the draft to a journal; maybe produce a revision following the suggestions of the reviewers and editors; and hopefully live long enough to actually see it published. All of these steps are closed to the public except for the last one – the publication of the (often substantially) revised version of the paper. Journal editors and reviewers evaluate the written work submitted to them, they trust that the analyses described in the submission are done in a principled and correct way. Editors and reviewers are the only external part of this process who will have an active influence on what analyses are done. After the publication of an article the public has the opportunity to write comments or ask the authors for the actual datasets for re-analysis. Often however, getting access to data from published papers is hard, if not often impossible (Savage & Vickers, 2009; Wicherts, Borsboom, Kats, & Molenaar, 2006).  Unfortunately only the gist of the analyses are described in the paper and neither exact verification nor innovative additional analyses are possible.\nWhat could be a solution for this problem? An example from computer science provides a concept called “literate programming” which was advocated by one of the field’s grandmasters, Donald Knuth, in 1984. Knuth suggested that documentation (comments in the code) should be just as important as the actual code itself. This idea was reflected nearly 20 years later when Schwab et al. (2000) formulated a concept that “replication by other scientists” is a central aim and guardian for intellectual quality; they coined the term “reproducible research” for such a process.\nLet’s move the research process to a more open, reproducible structure, in which scientific peers have the ability to evaluate not only the final publication but also the data and the analyses.\nIdeally, research papers would have code for analyses which are commented in detail and are submitted in tandem with drafts as well as the original datasets. Anybody, not only a restricted group of select reviewers and editors, could reproduce all the steps of the analysis and follow the logic of arguments on not only the conceptual level but at an analytic level as well. This openness facilities easy reanalysis of data also. Meta-analysis could be done more frequently and with greater resolution as the actual data are available. Moreover, this configuration would allow us collectively to estimate effects in the population and not restrict our attention to independent small samples (see Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010 for a discussion of this topic).\nWhat do we need to achieve this? From a policy perspective, journals would have to add the requirement for data and code submission together with the draft of each empirical paper. Some journals already provide the option to do that (e.g., Behavior Research Methods) in the supplemental material section on a voluntary base, some require the submission of all necessary material to replicate the reported results (e.g., Econometrica), however most do not offer such a possibility (it is of course possible to provide such materials through private or university web sites, but this is a haphazard and decentralized arrangement).\nTools are a second important part of facilitating this openness. Three open source (free of cost) components could provide the bases for reproducible research:\n\nR (R Development Core Team, 2010) is widely recognized (cite) as the “language of statistics” and builds on writing code instead of a “click and forget” type of analysis that other software packages encourage. R is open source, comes with a large number of extensions for advanced statistical analysis and can be run on any computer platform, including as a Web based application (http://www.R-project.org).\nLaTeX was invented to provide a tool for anybody to produce high quality publications independent of the computer system used (i.e. one could expect the same results everywhere, http://www.latex-project.org/).\nSweave (Leisch, 2002) connects R and LaTeX providing the opportunity to write a research paper and do the data analysis in parallel, in a well documented and reproducible way (http://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/).\n\nThe power of these different tools comes from the combination of their being open source, their widespread adoption (across a wide range of fields in sciences), and the fully transparent means by which data analysis is conducted and reported.  It levels the playing field and means that anybody with an Internet connection and a computer can take part in evolving scientific progress.\nJohn Godfrey Saxe famously said that: “Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made.” We should strive that this is not true for psychology as a science."

We further found that reminders of money increased preference for a free-market system of organ transplants that benefited the wealthy at the expense of the poor even though this was not the prevailing system (Experiment 5) and that this effect was moderated by participants’ nationality. These results demonstrate how merely thinking about money can influence beliefs about the social order and the extent to which people deserve their station in life."

While the literature has found that priming money has notable psychological consequences, little research has been done on the impact of priming money on consumer choice, particularly, their choice between hedonic and utilitarian options. The current research proposes that priming money will increase the likelihood of a prevention regulatory focus, and consequently, consumers will be more likely to choose more prudent alternatives when facing a trade- off between hedonic and utilitarian options. Results of four experiments show that participants in the money priming condition were more likely to choose utilitarian over hedonic options, compared with participants in the control condition. Furthermore, this effect was mediated by consumers’ situational prevention focus on the exposure to money primes, but attenuated when credit cards are primed."

Inspecting Table 1 from Caruso et al (Figure 1) we see that the Money (Priming) condition, in all three experiments, resulted in higher values on each of these scales. It is noteworthy, that there is variance between the three experiments in terms of differences between Money-Control in absolute values (0.07, 0.21, 0.64, respectively) but also in terms of effect sizes of the three t-tests: d = .80, .40 and .51 (respectively for Exp1, 2 and 3).\n\nHow we (re-)built the different conditions\nIn their Experiment 1 Caruso et al. used pictures of a US Dollar note (Priming) or noise (Control) as displayed in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pictures from the Priming and Control Condition, Caruso et al. (2013)\n\n\n\nWe adapted these pictures to Swiss money (see Figure 3) or a neutral picture (see ?@fig-background-control) as the background in the SJS questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Background money prime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Background neutral\n\n\n\nFor the Belief in a Just World scale in Caruso Experiment 2 / 3 and Tong Experiment 1 we used a sentence scrambling task similar to the one in Caruso et al. (2013) with translated (to German) and adapted sentences. We rated each of the suggested sentences for their fit to the current study and picked the ones with the highest overall rating by all collaborators in this study.\nThe final set of sentence is the following:\n\n\n\nSentence priming stimuli for Control and Priming\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondition\nsentence\n\n\n\n\nControl\nIch gehe immer am zweiten Dienstag des Monats ins Tanzen.\n\n\nControl\nSein Wissen stieg mit der Anzahl besuchter Kurse.\n\n\nControl\nKontinuität ist der Schlüssel zu einem langfristigen Erfolg.\n\n\nControl\nAuf dem Weg nach Hause verlor ich meine Kopfhörer.\n\n\nControl\nDamit ich von meinem Freund einen Apfel bekomme gebe ich ihm Schokolade.\n\n\nControl\nIch stehe am Morgen auf um den Alltag zu bestreiten.\n\n\nControl\nBeim Einkaufen wähle ich Produkte der Intuition nach .\n\n\nControl\nMit genug Willenskraft kannst du viele Träume verwirklichen.\n\n\nControl\nReiseunternehmen beschäftigen sich mit Ländern auf der ganzen Welt.\n\n\nControl\nFerienmangel kann im Alltag zu Angst und Stress führen.\n\n\nControl\nNach jahrelanger Abklärung erhielt sie endlich eine Bewilligung.\n\n\nControl\nIch muss mein ungesundes, kalorienreiches Essverhalten neu überdenken.\n\n\nControl\nFleiss und aktives Engagement ermöglichen es mir meine Träume zu erfüllen.\n\n\nControl\nDie Teilnehmer wurden gebeten über ihre täglichen Routinen nachzudenken.\n\n\nControl\nDas kleine Kind kaut Kaugummis vor der Schule.\n\n\nPriming\nIch bezahle meine Rechnungen immer am zweiten Dienstag des Monats.\n\n\nPriming\nSein Vermögen wuchs durch kluge Investitionen in Aktien.\n\n\nPriming\nSparen ist langfristig der Schlüssel zur finanziellen Stabilität.\n\n\nPriming\nAuf dem Weg nach Hause verlor ich meine Brieftasche.\n\n\nPriming\nDamit ich von einem Freund Schokolade bekomme, gebe ich ihm Geld.\n\n\nPriming\nIch stehe am Morgen auf, um Geld zu verdienen.\n\n\nPriming\nBeim Einkaufen achte ich auf den Preis.\n\n\nPriming\nMit genug Geld kannst du viele Träume verwirklichen.\n\n\nPriming\nDer Finanzmarkt beschäftigt sich auf der ganzen Welt mit Geldflüssen.\n\n\nPriming\nStress und Geldnöte im Alltag können zu Angst im Alltag führen.\n\n\nPriming\nNach jahrelanger Arbeit erhielt sie endlich eine Gehaltserhöhung.\n\n\nPriming\nIch muss mein monatliches knappes Budget neu überdenken.\n\n\nPriming\nMacht und Geld ermöglichen es mir, meine Träume zu erfüllen.\n\n\nPriming\nDie Teilnehmer wurden gebeten, über ihre aktuellen Geldausgaben nachzudenken.\n\n\nPriming\nDas kleine Kind kauft vor der Schule Kaugummis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for Tong Experiment 2 / 3, we generated a new sorting task, where participants were asked to sort pictures of either currencies (Money Prime, see Figure 5) or pictures of different languages (control) into pre-defined classes (see Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Money sorting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Text sorting"

    "text": "What we are looking for in Tong et al.\nThe three experiments in Tong et al. (2013) also use different priming methods: sentence construction (as in Caruso et al. 2013, see @tab-results-sentence) and a sorting task (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). The dependent measures were simple choices in this study, between different sets of goods that have either more hedonic (cake, Sci-Fi Book, Coke) or more utilitarian (battery, dictionary, pen) connotation.\nFollowing the original paper, we used the same analytic strategy and calculated chi-2 tests separately for each of three experiments.\nInspecting the results in Tong et al. (2013) the following patterns were found. I will simply summaries the choices in the money priming condition where in Exp 1: 70 % / Exp 2: 57 % / Exp 3: 77 % of participants choose the hedonic option compared to Exp 1: 40 % / Exp 2: 30 % / Exp 3: 55 % in the control condition). So overall sizable differences in the choice patterns between 22 and 30 points difference between the conditions.\n\nTong 1 Battery Cake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Results Replication Tong Experiment 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  T1_BC$Condition and T1_BC$Choice_T_Battery\nX-squared = 0.9, df = 1, p-value = 0.3\n\n\n\n\nTong 2 Sci-Fi Duden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Results Replication Tong Experiment 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  T2_Book$Condition and T2_Book$Choice\nX-squared = 0.8, df = 1, p-value = 0.4\n\n\n\n\nTong 3 Pen v.

Overall the conditions differ around 10 % between control and money priming - which is much smaller, than in the original."

    "section": "Framing",
    "text": "Framing\nSo, lets get started with some framing tasks … we use the same paradigm as Peters et al. (2006) in that we let a participants judge a Psych student’s test score either in a positive or negative frame. An example for a positive frame was Emily got 74% of her test correct the connected negative version was: Emily got 26% of her test incorrect. We then varied the percentage correct [81, 78, 74, 71, 68] and incorrect and the names of students [Emily, Fabian, Anna, Luca, Laura] in a between subjects design, where participants were either subjected to the positive or negative framing condition.\nAveraging these ratings we find a somewhat small but, as we will see, significant difference between positive and negative framing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2: Framing separated by task.\n\n\n\n\nLets do a simple ANOVA and compare these means for Numeracy [high|low] x Framing [pos|neg].\n\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nframe         1     81    81.2    76.8 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   928    981     1.1                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nAlright, framing effect ✓ with a mean rating of M = 0.82 (SD = 1.21) for ‘negative’ and M = 1.41 (SD = 0.82) for ‘positive’ - not a total disaster … which can be confirmed by calculation of Cohen’s d = 0.57.\n\nSome checking\nBefore we get going into the details, I will do some checking whether the tasks worked. In what follows I split the data for positive and negative frame from Fig. 2 into the 5 task variations we used. Remember that these have decreasing distance between the positive and negative framing condition - the positive percentages correct are: [81, 78, 74, 71, 68]. The first number in the column headings represent the negative frame, the second the positive, hence the first column is the 19% negative v. 81% positive condition and so on. Participants react to these differences with decreasing general ratings when the negative result increases. Pretty good!\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3: Sanity checks.\n\n\n\n\nThe Framing effect is small in the 19-81 condition and increases with increasing negative and connected decreasing positive percentage. I am using the map() function to run an Anova for each task_id - which will give us 5 Anovas with 2 lines each in the results tibble - here is the code that does that - a simple t-test would do the same, but could not figure out how to map that …\n\nframing %&gt;% \n  nest(data = -task_id) %&gt;% \n  mutate(model = map(data, ~ anova(lm(rating ~ frame, .)))) %&gt;% \nselect(task_id, model) %&gt;% \nunnest(model)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 6\n   task_id    Df `Sum Sq` `Mean Sq` `F value`  `Pr(&gt;F)`\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1       1     1    15.5     15.5       17.7   4.02e- 5\n 2       1   184   161.       0.877     NA    NA       \n 3       2     1     6.42     6.42       8.38  4.26e- 3\n 4       2   184   141.       0.767     NA    NA       \n 5       3     1    41.9     41.9       48.5   5.72e-11\n 6       3   184   159.       0.865     NA    NA       \n 7       4     1     7.77     7.77       9.62  2.23e- 3\n 8       4   184   149.       0.808     NA    NA       \n 9       5     1    19.4     19.4       21.5   6.66e- 6\n10       5   184   166.       0.904     NA    NA       \n\n\nPretty neat - and confirming what we suspected above - significant framing effect for each task and difference between results for the rated student."

    "text": "We got a new paper out on how people (consumers) use simple rules to make food choices. This is work in collaboration with the Nestlé Research Center in Lausanne.\nHere is the reference:\n\nSchulte-Mecklenbeck, M., Sohn, M., Bellis, E., Martin, N., & Hertwig, R. (2013). A Lack of Appetite for Information and Computation: Simple Heuristics in Food Choice. Appetite, 71, 242–251.\n\nAbstract\nThe predominant, but largely untested, assumption in research on food choice is that people obey the classic commandments of rational behavior: they carefully look up every piece of relevant information, weight each piece according to subjective importance, and then combine them into a judgment or choice. In real world situations, however, the available time, motivation, and computational resources may simply not suffice to keep these commandments. Indeed, there is a large body of research suggesting that human choice is often better accommodated by heuristics—simple rules that enable decision making on the basis of a few, but important, pieces of information. We investigated the prevalence of such heuristics in a computerized experiment that engaged participants in a series of choices between two lunch dishes. Employing MouselabWeb, a process-tracing technique, we found that simple heuristics described an overwhelmingly large proportion of choices, whereas strategies traditionally deemed rational were barely apparent in our data. Replicating previous findings, we also observed that visual stimulus segments received a much larger proportion of attention than any nutritional values did. Our results suggest that, consistent with human behavior in other domains, people make their food choices on the basis of simple and informationally frugal heuristics."

    "text": "As mentioned some days ago our Handbook of Process Tracing Methods is out in the wild …\nHere is a bit of an overview of what is going on inside :)\nThe book has 390 pages divided into 24 chapters. There are 202014 words in there including everything (references, thanks, hello, goodbye …).\nIgnoring the chapters and that they have reference lists, that mess up things a bit, first an overview of frequency for highly frequent words:\n\nNo big surprises there for a process tracing book in decision making - but still - models pop up quite high in the list and trajectories - the new kid on the block when it comes to mousetracking also gets a mention - the list is truncated and I did not bother to remove things like ‘et al.’ or ‘e.g’ (the second . got caught by the script, the first one not).\n\nThis is more interesting - I calculated the tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency) which tells us how important a word is but takes care of how often a word appears in general - so a better measure than just using the raw frequency of a word. I did this for each chapter (chapter names are listed in the other post). At first I wanted to remove the reference list but I realized that it provides an interesting insight - namely how often authors cite themselves in their chapters. A caveat in this graph is that the x-axis has different scaling. Apart from that it actually describes the content of some of the chapters pretty well - ah and I just saw that I should have added some stemming to avoid ‘clusters’ and ‘cluster’ being listed separatly … but well …\nFor the kicks - here is a network diagram of bigrams. There is clearly some more work to do here …\n\nShoutout to the tidytext people - you got a great package there!"

    "text": "I wrote this letter to the black goat podcast … will update here if I hear back from them …\n \nDear goaters (is this a good way to address the three of you?),\n\n\n\n\nI attended SIPS some weeks ago (first timer). I was unsure what to expect but got a lot of bang for my buck (which is great) – as a side note I would recommend first timers to try to go there with a concrete project or question or problem, I think there is a good chance to find people with similar issues interested in collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is an observation I would be interested to hear your thoughts on: in the SIPS world everything seems to be really straight forward – we want to ‘unfuck psych science’ (Lindsay, 2018), we want to pre-reg studies, upload data, learn R, comment on code, accelerate science, ‘do it right this time’, collaborate, respect, be inclusive (I really learned a lot in that regard listening to your podcast and talking to people at SIPS) …\n\n\nAll of that is great. I subscribe to all of these points.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the twist – people @SIPS talk about ‘a movement’  (something that seems very American to me), maybe a movement is needed; people @SIPS talk about ‘a revolution’ – again, great! obviously there is a need to rattle the cage and accelerate things beyond ‘paradigm shifts at funerals’ (Planck?)\n\n\nBUT\n\n\nWhat happens if you go ‘Outside the SIPS Bubble’ (OSIPSB)?\n\n\nI have no data (other than my own experiences) but I wonder whether the world (psychology, other sciences) is actually that ready, that willing and open to adopt to these new standards and to actually make a paradigm shift in how we do science. I work at a business school (consumer psych and JDM) there is a lot of finger pointing going on toward psychology (I have a similar feeling that within psychology there is a lot of finger pointing toward social psych) – ‘this is clearly a problem of psychologists but not of us [economists, consumer psychologists, business, accounting researchers …]’.\n\n\nAnother OSIPSB experience I had was talking to an Action Editor of the Journal of Consumer Psychology (JCR) last year – we got into a heated debate about the most basic issues, eg, sharing data, pre-reg studies …\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an observation you share? What would be good steps to address these issues? Should we talk about this within SIPS to get a better balance between enthusiasm and real world requirements (eg hiring decisions are still made mostly by senior faculty, assuming my observation hold, less interested in replication than ’new and exciting effects’ (quote anonymous senior AE of JCR).\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE in 2019 - on my way to SIPS2019, casually started listening to some podcasts - and then this: https://www.podbean.com/ew/pb-2iqpx-b6aa1e"

    "text": "This is one of the fastest papers I have ever written. It was a great collaboration with Tomás Lejarraga from the Universitat de les Illes Balears. Why was it great? Because it is one of the rare cases (at least in my academic life) where all people involved in a project contribute equally and quickly. Often, the weight of a contribution lies with one person which slows down things – with Tomás this was different – we were often sitting in front of a computer writing together (have never done this before, thought it would not work). Surprisingly this collaborative writing worked out very well and we had the skeleton of the paper within an afternoon. This was followed by many hours of tuning and tacking turns – but in principle we wrote the most important parts together – which was pretty cool.\nEven cooler – you can do eye-tracking in groups, using our code.\nHere is the [PDF] and abstract:\nThe recent introduction of inexpensive eye-trackers has opened up a wealth of opportunities for researchers to study attention in interactive tasks. No software package was previously available to help researchers exploit those opportunities. We created “the pyeTribe”, a software package that offers, among others, the following features: First, a communication platform between many eye-trackers to allow simultaneous recording of multiple participants. Second, the simultaneous calibration of multiple eye-trackers without the experimenter’s supervision. Third, data collection restricted to periods of interest, thus reducing the volume of data and easing analysis. We used a standard economic game (the public goods game) to examine data quality and demonstrate the potential of our software package. Moreover, we conducted a modeling analysis, which illustrates how combining process and behavioral data can improve models of human decision making behavior in social situations. Our software is open source and can thus be used and improved by others."
