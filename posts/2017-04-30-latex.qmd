I have been using LaTeX (with pdfTeX) for 20+ years now &#8211; to be honest I never bothered to understand the differences between the different TeX engines &#8211; [here](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/500-whats-in-a-name-a-guide-to-the-many-flavours-of-tex#.WQbPt1KB3UI) is an excellent article by [Graham Douglas](https://twitter.com/publishergeek) explaining the ins and outs of the TeX engine(s).

&#8230; the article also features [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)Â a shared TeX environment &#8230; sweet!
