The friendly people from RStudio recently started a [webinar series](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) with talks on the following topics (among others):

Data wrangling with R and RStudio  
The Grammar and Graphics of Data Science (both dplyr happiness)  
RStudio and Shiny

&#8230; and many more.

Our friend [Dr. Nathaniel D. Philipps](http://nathanieldphillips.com/) also started a cool [R course](http://nathanieldphillips.com/r-course/) with videos, shiny apps and many other new goodies.
