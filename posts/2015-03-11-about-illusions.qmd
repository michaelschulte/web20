[Andrew Gelman talked](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/03/10/the-illusion-of-the-illusion-of-control/) about a really [old paper](http://www.schulte-mecklenbeck.com/pubs/Kuehberger1995.pdf) I did together with [Anton Kühberger](http://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=29678) ages ago. It was actually the first paper / &#8216;real&#8217; scientific project I was involved in.

It generated quite the buzz over its 20 year lifespan and was cited a whopping 13 times (stats look good without y-axis) &#8230;

Going back to it, I was happy to see that we already talked about replication (and were very reluctant to push the button harder &#8211; as we would have not been able to get through the reviews, I guess) &#8230; Things have changed.
