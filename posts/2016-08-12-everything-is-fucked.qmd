This syllabus of an (obviously) awesome class has a ton of good reads:

[Everything is fucked: The&nbsp;syllabus](https://hardsci.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/everything-is-fucked-the-syllabus/)

by Sanjay Srivastava

I would have two additions:

  1. [A multi lab replication project on ego-depletion](http://webcom.upmf-grenoble.fr/LIP/DMuller/resources/documents/HCAetal-IP-PPS.pdf) (Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2016)
  2. And the [response](doi: 10.1177/1745691616652878) from Roy Baumeister and Kathleen D. Vohs

It&#8217;s a really good statement of how f&#8230; up things are (in addition to all the other good examples above) &#8230;

  “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.” &#8211; Max Planck
