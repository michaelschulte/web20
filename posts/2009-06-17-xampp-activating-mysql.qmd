Here is the problem: I want to have a server (Apache, MySQL) on my local machine (for the current purpose it was a Windows machine) to do some developing, testing or a demo. Getting [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) at [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net) is straight forward, installing it works like a charm.

BUT

A problem coming back from time to time is the following: the MySQL daemon does not start.  
Hmmmm

Here are some steps that helped me:

1) make sure to deactivate any services related to MySQL and Apache  
2) shutdown XAMPP  
3) to be sure I restart the machine  
4) do not start XAMPP with the .bat file but use the MySQL and Apache batch scripts &#8211; these open a command window which you should not close as long as you use XAMPP

Through these steps everything worked fine &#8230;
