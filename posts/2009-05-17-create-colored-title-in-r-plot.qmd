David Smith has a very nice code example in which he sets the color of title word in a plot to the actual grouping color. Code can be found [here](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/01/multicolor-text-in-r.html). This seems extremely useful for posters and presentations. I doubt however that journals would pick up on that &#8230;
