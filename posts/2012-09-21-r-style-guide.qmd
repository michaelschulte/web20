This is mainly a note to self:

There are several style guides for R out there. I particularly like the one from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml "Google R Style Guide")Â and the somewhat lighter [version of Hadley](http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html) (ggplot god).

All of that style guide thinking started after a question on <stackoverflow.com> about R workflow &#8230; How do we organize large R projects. Hadley (again) is favoring an Load-Clean-Func-Do approach which looks somewhat like that:

  * load.R # load data
  * clean.R # clean up crap
  * func.R # add functions
  * do.R # do the work
