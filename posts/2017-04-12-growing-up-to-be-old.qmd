Some papers have somewhat weird starting points &#8211; this one had an awesome starting point &#8211; Lake Louise (Canada):

In a little suite we ([Joe Johnson](https://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/psychology/about/current-faculty-staff/johnson-joseph/index.html), [Ulf Böckenholt](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/bockenholt_ulf.aspx), [Dan Goldstein](http://www.dangoldstein.com), [Jay Russo](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Faculty-And-Research/Profile?id=jer9), [Nikki Sullivan](https://sites.duke.edu/huettellab/post-doc-nikki-sullivan/), [Martijn Willemsen](https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences/the-department/staff/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/19980508/)) sat down during a conference called the &#8216;[Choice Symposium](https://www.choicesymposium.com/)&#8216; and started working on an overview paper about the history and current status of different process tracing methods. One central result (why can&#8217;t all papers be like that) is the figure below where we try to locate many process tracing methods on the two dimensions: temporal resolution and distortion risk (i.e., how fast can a method measure a process and how destructive is this measurement).
