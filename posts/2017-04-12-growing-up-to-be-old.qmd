Some papers have somewhat weird starting points &#8211; this one had an awesome starting point &#8211; Lake Louise (Canada):

In a little suite we ([Joe Johnson](https://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/psychology/about/current-faculty-staff/johnson-joseph/index.html), [Ulf Böckenholt](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/bockenholt_ulf.aspx), [Dan Goldstein](http://www.dangoldstein.com), [Jay Russo](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Faculty-And-Research/Profile?id=jer9), [Nikki Sullivan](https://sites.duke.edu/huettellab/post-doc-nikki-sullivan/), [Martijn Willemsen](https://www.tue.nl/en/university/departments/industrial-engineering-innovation-sciences/the-department/staff/detail/ep/e/d/ep-uid/19980508/)) sat down during a conference called the &#8216;[Choice Symposium](https://www.choicesymposium.com/)&#8216; and started working on an overview paper about the history and current status of different process tracing methods. One central result (why can&#8217;t all papers be like that) is the figure below where we try to locate many process tracing methods on the two dimensions: temporal resolution and distortion risk (i.e., how fast can a method measure a process and how destructive is this measurement).

Schulte-Mecklenbeck, M., Johnson, J.G., Böckenholt, U., Goldstein, D., Russo, J., Sullivan, N., &  Willemsen, M. (2017). <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417708229'>Process tracing methods in decision making: On growing up in the 70ties</a>. _Current Directions in Psychological Science_.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-503" src="/uploads//2017/04/40years.png" alt="" width="2496" height="1404" srcset="2017/04/40years.png 2496w, 2017/04/40years-300x169.png 300w, 2017/04/40years-768x432.png 768w, 2017/04/40years-1024x576.png 1024w, 2017/04/40years-889x500.png 889w, 2017/04/40years-500x281.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2496px) 100vw, 2496px" />

Ah &#8211; everybody was trying to find a path all the time:<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-506" src="/uploads//2017/04/lost-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" srcset="2017/04/lost-1024x768.jpg 1024w, 2017/04/lost-300x225.jpg 300w, 2017/04/lost-768x576.jpg 768w, 2017/04/lost-667x500.jpg 667w, 2017/04/lost-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" />
