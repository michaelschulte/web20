It is kind of an odd problem.  
For the following pretty straight forward question: How do I randomise questions within a group in [Limesurvey](http://www.limesurvey.org/)? It seems to be really hard to find an answer.

With the help of Jonas I figured out that there is a randomisation option hidden in the &#8216;Advanced Settings&#8217; section of a question. What you have to do is provide the same number (this is important) for each question in a group that you want to randomise. Limesurvey will then take care of the rest. It did not seem to work if I named the variable with a string, eg, &#8216;group1&#8217; but only numeric counters work fine.

Thanks Jonas! (I would not have finished at all) &#8230;
