[Ilias](https://www.ilias.de/en/lms-ilias-solutions-university/) is the start and end of all sorrow. Unfortunatly (my uni)[www.unibe.ch] is locked in with Ilias - this post is not about this sad truth but a solution for all my interactions with students in my courses. What I was looking for is an easy, reproducible solution that allows me to generate slides, pdfs of said slides (students want pdfs for taking notes) and a webpage with all the necessary info about the course in one go. Ideally I want to work together with a TA on all of this. 

So, here we go: I am teaching a lot of methods courses - hence [Quarto](quarto.org) is a natural choice. For the combination of slides and a webpage a Quarto Project.  

Simply get started with:

![Quarto project setup](images/project_setup.png)
What you get from this is a new R-Project (I chose a new folder on my Desktop), called it `Course_Project` and also setup a git repo right away (more about that later). Within the project folder you will find a .qmd file that will hold the landing page, an .Rproj file to keep things together and a `_quarto.yml` file to configure everything. You can already open an render the .qmd file and will see a simple html page.
