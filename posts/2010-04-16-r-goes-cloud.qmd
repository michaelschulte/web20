[Jeroen Ooms](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/cv.html) did for R what Google did for editing documents online. He created several software packages that help running R with a nice frontend over the Internet.  
I first learned about Jeroen&#8217;s website through his [implementation of ggplot2](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/ggplot2/) &#8211; this page is useful to generate graphs with the powerful ggplot2 package without R knowledge, however it is even more helpful to learn ggplot2 code with the View-code panel function which displays the underlying R code. If you are into random effect models another package connected to [lme4](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~jeroen/lme4.html) will guide you step by step through model building.  
I think this is a great step forward for R and cloud computing!
