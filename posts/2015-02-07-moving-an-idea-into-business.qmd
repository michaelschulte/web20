Recently [Ryan Murphy](http://vlab.ethz.ch/ROM/DBGT/Homepage.html) and myself realised that a startup here in Berlin features ideas of our 2011 [Flashlight paper](http://www.schulte-mecklenbeck.com/pubs/Schulte2011.pdf).

Well, the guys at [attensee.com](http://www.attensee.com) did a great job taking the idea we had much further we ever thought one would be able to take it &#8230;

Here is a feature I totally love &#8211; a live heat map of what you are looking at &#8230; awesome!
